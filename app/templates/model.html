<p> I hand pick out the features that exists in both my historical data and new listing data retrived from Lending company api. 

The most important features are: Term, FICO Score, Loan Amount, Home Ownership, Dept to Income Ratio, Total Number of Accounts, Credit History, Employment Status, etc. Some of the feature engineering was done here, for example, I take the log of the annual income and reduce the number of categories of the home ownership, The credit history length is computed by the loan application date minus earliest credit line.  For lending club, the joint feature is integrated into the primary application (basically boost his or hers features). </p>

<p> Most investors are aware, lending out money to other people come with a risk. The loan will start when the investor decides to take the risk. How about after the loan start? Should the investor expect the money coming back? Here, I used the Kaplanâ€“Meier estimator and developed a real time loan survival model, basically computes the probability of an ongoing loan being paid off on time given its current activity. Therefore, investors have a batter idea of there money, and lead to smarter investment. </p>
